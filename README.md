### Visualising Data Acquired from CSV files

- There exists a file `scatter.py` in **src** which will take a CSV file and output a plot of the data. \

  ```python
      filename = 'scope_0.csv' # CSV file to be plotted
  ```

  This will also save a high-quality png into the same directory as the 'scatter.py' file. This plot is generated \
  from the matplotlib library and looks like the plot below
