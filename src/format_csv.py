def csv_format(filename: str):
    '''
        Takes a csv file and formats it in such a way that can be 
        plotted using the matplotlib library. Essentially, this is changing 
        each header to not include hyphens (such as x-axis) or plain integers
        It also deletes any rows with empty values 

        Arguments:
            filename (str)    - name of the csv file to be plotted

        Exceptions:
            InputError  - Occurs when   1) filename is not a string
                                        2) filename does not exist
                                        3) filename is not a csv file

        Return Value:
            None
